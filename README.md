# Chip8  
  My first actual emulator.  
  Kinda works, at least has some output, which is better than I thought I could do.  
  Fun to learn how the actual internals of the computer works instead of just a big magic box.
  
  This project implements all the basic parts of the Chip-8 CPU, a theoretical CPU that was created in around the 60-70s.
  A bit old but a good way to learn how the basics work.
  
  Honestly project I am most proud of even if it isn't 100%.
